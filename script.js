function abc() {
    console.log("abc.xyz")

}
abc();
abc.xyz = 400
abc.xyz = 200
abc();

three phases of event propogation

const numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4}
numbers[100] = 500
console.log(numbers)
is it the right way of putting value 500 at 100 index

console.log(typeof typeof 100)

const arr[...'praveen']
console.log(arr)

what is parseInt
console.log(parseInt('10+2'))
console.log(parseInt('7FM'))
console.log(parseInt('M7F'))

what is isNaN
console.log(isNaN('praveen'))

console.log([1, 2].map(num => {
    if (nums > 0) return;
    return num * 2
}))

function abc() {
    return;
}
console.log(abc())

'use strict'//does this affect anything
{
    function abx() {
        console.log('praveen')
    }
}
abx()

what is window scope

function abc() {
    'use strict'
    a = 100;
    b = 100
    return arguments[0] + arguments[1]
    console.log(a + b)
}
console.log(abc(300, 400))

example of mutable arrays
shift, unshift for mutable arrays

what splice and slice method

what find method does
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const found = arr.find(num => num > 4);
const filtered = arr.filter(num => num > 4);
const mapResult = arr.map(num => num > 2);
console.log(mapResult);
console.log(filtered); // Output: [5, 6, 7, 8]
console.log(found); // Output: 5
